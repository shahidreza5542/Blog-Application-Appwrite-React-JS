# Quick Deployment Fix for Vercel

## Problem Fixed
The "Network error" during build was caused by:
1. API calls being made during build time (SSR)
2. Missing terser dependency
3. Environment variables not being handled properly during build

## Changes Made

### 1. **MainContext.jsx** - Prevent API calls during build
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Only run API calls in browser environment, not during build
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    fetchUser()
    fetchAllHomeBlogs()
  } else {
    // During build time, just set loading to false
    setLoading(false)
    SetCheckOnece(false)
  }
}, [])
```

### 2. **appwrite.js** - Skip Appwrite initialization during build
```javascript
// Only initialize Appwrite client in browser environment
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  // Initialize client
} else {
  console.log('Skipping Appwrite initialization during build');
}
```

### 3. **vite.config.js** - Use esbuild instead of terser
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
  build: {
    minify: 'esbuild', // Instead of terser
    rollupOptions: {
      external: [],
    },
  },
})
```

### 4. **constant.js** - Added fallback values
```javascript
export const ENVObj = {
    VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID: import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID || '68dd1321000ff8ca3f65',
    // ... other variables with fallbacks
}
```

## Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push your changes to GitHub**
2. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Set environment variables:
     ```
     VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=68dd1321000ff8ca3f65
     VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
     VITE_APPWRITE_DB_ID=68de6d520003b0b5a475
     VITE_APPWRITE_PROFILE_COLLECTION_ID=9213506847
     VITE_APPWRITE_STORAGE_ID=68dd32cf000876f0679e
     VITE_APPWRITE_BLOG_COLLECTION_ID=5BxL8kPq9W
     VITE_APPWRITE_COMMENT_COLLECTION_ID=
     ```
   - Deploy

3. **After deployment, in Appwrite Console:**
   - Go to Settings > Domains
   - Add your Vercel domain (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
   - Update collection permissions as mentioned in DEPLOYMENT.md

## Test Commands (Optional)
```bash
# Test build locally (should work now)
npm run build

# Test preview
npm run preview
```

The build should now complete successfully without network errors!
